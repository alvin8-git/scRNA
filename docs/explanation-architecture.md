# Pipeline Architecture

This document explains why the pipeline is structured the way it is — the decisions behind the modular design, the sample cache, parallel execution, and the two-pass report system.

## The problem

Single-cell RNA-seq analysis involves 10+ sequential stages, each taking minutes to hours. Running everything in a single script means:

1. A failure at step 07 forces you to rerun hours of QC, clustering, and annotation.
2. Iterating on annotation (the most manual step) requires rerunning visualisation every time.
3. Adding one new sample to an existing cohort forces reprocessing of samples you have already QCed.

---

## The approach

```
run_pipeline.sh
      │
      ├── 01_load_qc.R      ──writes──► individual/<sample>/<sample>_filtered.rds
      ├── 02_doublets.R     ──writes──► individual/<sample>/<sample>_singlets.rds
      ├── 03_individual.R   ──writes──► individual/<sample>/<sample>_seurat.rds
      │                                sample_cache/<sample>/  ← shared cache (all three)
      ├── 04_integrate.R    ──reads─── sample_cache/*  ──writes──► integrated/integrated_seurat.rds
      ├── 05_annotate.R     ──writes──► integrated/integrated_annotated.rds
      ├── 06_visualize.R    ──writes──► visualization_report.pdf
      └── 07_finalize.R     ──writes──► Overall_report.pdf
```

Each step writes a `.rds` checkpoint. If you re-run starting at step 05, steps 01–04 are skipped entirely.

---

## The sample cache

Steps 01–03 are per-sample. Each writes its checkpoint to both the run-specific directory and
`sample_cache/<sample>/` — `_filtered.rds` from 01, `_singlets.rds` (plus the doublet plots) from 02,
`_seurat.rds` from 03. Each of those steps checks its own cache entry on entry and skips the work on a
hit, so a sample already processed in an earlier run costs nothing in the next:

```
Run: ES03 + ES12 → processes both, caches both
Run: ES03 + ES14 → ES03 loaded from cache; only ES14 processed
```

This makes adding a new sample to a cohort fast: only the new sample is processed; integration and annotation re-run on the full set.

**Cache key.** `cache_hash(sample, step)` in `config.R` hashes three things: a fingerprint of the
input matrix files (size + mtime, falling back to the path alone when unreadable), the sample path,
and the parameters that step actually depends on — `QC` + species for 01, plus `DOUBLET` for 02, plus
`NORM`/`DIM`/`CLUSTER` for 03. So lowering `min_counts` or changing clustering resolution invalidates
the affected entries automatically.

**Trade-off:** parameters consumed *after* step 03 are deliberately not part of the key — changing
`HARMONY`, `MARKERS`, `SINGLER_REF`, or `CLUSTER_CELLTYPE_MAP` does not invalidate anything, because
those only affect steps 04 onward, which never read from the cache. If you need to force a sample
through 01–03 again for any other reason, delete its cache subfolder: `rm -rf sample_cache/<sample>/`.

## Harmony for batch correction

When multiple samples are provided, UMAP clusters by sample rather than biology without correction. Harmony corrects this by embedding cells into a shared low-dimensional space where the sample dimension is minimised.

```
Without Harmony:          With Harmony:
  UMAP clusters by         UMAP clusters by
  sample identity          cell type
  ────────────             ────────────
  ●●●● (ES03)              ●○●○ (CD4 T)
  ○○○○ (ES12)              ●○●○ (NK)
```

**Trade-off:** Harmony can over-correct if `theta` is too high, merging biologically distinct populations. The default `theta=2` is appropriate for samples from the same tissue type. Raise to 3–5 only for strong batch effects (different sequencing platforms or tissue sources).

The pipeline saves a UMAP before and after Harmony (`integration_umap_before.pdf`, `integration_umap_after.pdf`) so you can verify the correction visually.

## Two annotation routes

Step 05 assigns cell types via two independent routes:

**Route 1 — SingleR (reference-based):**
Scores every cell against a curated reference transcriptome. Fast and unbiased, but constrained to cell types that exist in the reference. Good for identifying major immune populations.

**Route 2 — Cluster majority vote + manual override:**
Aggregates per-cell SingleR labels to a per-cluster label. The majority label wins. A `CLUSTER_CELLTYPE_MAP` lets you correct obvious errors without rerunning SingleR.

**Why both?** SingleR at the per-cell level is noisy for rare populations (a Neutrophil cluster containing 3% NK contamination would be mislabelled as NK by majority vote). The contamination-types list addresses this: cells whose per-cell SingleR label matches a contamination type always keep that label, bypassing majority vote.

See [Annotation Strategy](explanation-annotation.md) for a deeper treatment.

## Per-plot captions in `Overall_report.pdf`

Every figure in the Overall report has a `Good: … | Bad: …` interpretation caption. These are matched by pattern from `PLOT_CAPTIONS` in `config.R`. The goal: a reader who has never seen this pipeline can open the report and immediately understand what a good vs bad result looks like for each figure, without consulting documentation.

**Trade-off:** Captions are static text defined at pipeline write-time. They do not adapt to per-run statistics. A QC violin that looks good for PBMC might look different for whole blood — the captions provide guidance, not verdicts.

---

## Results directory naming

The results directory is named from the sample names: `results_ES03-ES12_filtered/`. This means:

- Multiple runs with different sample combinations do not overwrite each other.
- You can compare `results_ES03-ES12_filtered/` and `results_ES03-ES12-ES14_filtered/` side-by-side.
- The `_filtered` or `_raw` suffix records whether filtered or raw matrices were used.

**Trade-off:** Long sample lists produce long directory names. The pipeline truncates names beyond 8 samples to avoid filesystem limits.

## Parallelism

Two RAM-governed worker pools:
```r
PARALLEL$workers        # per-sample phase (01-03): cores-2, capped at 8, 8 GB/worker
PARALLEL$merge_workers  # merged-object phase (04-06b): fewer workers, 16 GB/worker
```

The per-sample phase fans out wide (small objects). The merged-object phase uses fewer workers because each one can hold a copy of the full merged object; a RAM governor reads `MemAvailable` and caps both counts so `workers × per-worker-budget` leaves ~20% headroom (prevents OOM in the fan-out phases).

`BiocParallel` drives scDblFinder (step 02) and SingleR (step 05); `future` multicore drives the Seurat steps. OMP/OpenBLAS/MKL/BLAS are pinned to 1 thread per process so worker-spawned BLAS pools don't oversubscribe the CPU.
